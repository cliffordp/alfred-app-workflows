# What are these?

Buy the [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) (only for Mac OS X) and then you can do all the things with [Alfred Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/)!

Each one needs to be installed individually so only install the ones you think you'll use. Once installed, you need to edit each one to set your preferred keyboard shortcut (i.e. Hotkey).

## Development

* [Run WordPress plugin Codeception test](https://github.com/cliffordp/alfred-app-workflows/blob/master/Run%20WordPress%20plugin%20Codeception%20wpunit%20test.alfredworkflow) allows you to copy the relative path of a Codeception test class file for a WordPress plugin, navigate to the plugin's root directory in Terminal, use your keyboard shortcut (Hotkey) to prepend Codeception's run command along with fixing the path to run, then hit Enter to run the entire class or append a method name to run just one test.
